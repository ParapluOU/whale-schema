// Test abstract types combined with inheritance
// This is the most common XSD pattern: abstract base + concrete derived

// Abstract base type (cannot be instantiated)
Vehicle: a{
    #manufacturer: String
}

// Concrete derived type that extends the abstract base
Car < Vehicle {
    #num-doors: Int
    #model: String
}

#car: Car
